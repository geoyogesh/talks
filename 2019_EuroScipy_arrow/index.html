# Open standards

???

give some examples:

* Human-readable semi-structured data: XML, JSON
* Structured data query language: SQL
* Binary storage formats (with metadata)
  * NetCDF
  * HDF5
  * Apache Parquet, ORC
* Serialization / RPC protocols
  * Apache Avro
  * Protocol buffers
* Not an open standard: Excel, CSV (grrrr)

Open standards: why do they matter?

* Simplify system architectures
* Reduce ecosystem fragmentation 
* Improve interoperability
* Reuse more libraries and algorithms

---

# Standardized in-memory data

--
count: false

* Example: numpy - strided ndarray memory layout

???

numpy's strided memory layout -> of course not limited to numpy, it's more universal, but it still is a standard

no-copy sharing of data (memoryviews)
buffer protocol

--
count: false

* Why?
  * Zero-overhead memory sharing between libraries in-memory and processes via shared memory (without serialization)
  * Reuse computational algorithms
  * Reuse IO / storage code

???

Why create open standards for in-memory? 

* Reuse computational algorithms
* Reuse IO / file format interfaces
* Move data structures without serializing
* Zero-copy shared memory access


---

# Columnar data - "data frames"

* Notoriously not based on open standards

--
count: false

* Python (pandas DataFrame), R (base data.frame, data.table), Julia, Spark, SQL databases, ...

???

Where are they found?
* Internals of SQL databases
* Big data systems (Apache Spark, Apache Hive)
* In-memory data frame libraries: Python (pandas), R (base, data.table), Julia (DataFrames.jl)


--
count: false

&rarr; Each has it's own "proprietary" memory layout

--
count: false


&rarr; Little code reuse across projects + high serialization costs

???

Pandas has a lot of code for IO, has its own "block manager" memory layout,
has a lot of code to perform operations on this, and its own API.
All this is very tightly integreated.
For example, pandas has quite some code written in cython for optimizing
the groupby operations. But currently that is very hard for someone else to reuse.

And R has all this of its own, each database has all this of its own, ...

Incompatible memory representations
Cannot share data without serialization
Cannot share algorithms because implementation depends on memory representation

## Arrow's Columnar Memory Format

.center[![:scale 60%](img/arrowsite-simd.png)]

* More native data types: string, date, decimal, nested data, ...
* Everyting is nullable
* Memory can be chunked
* Optimized layout for efficient access and processing

* Open standards:
  * Standardized language-independent columnar memory layout
  * Messaging protocol for serialization and interprocess communication (IPC)
* Libraries:
  * Implementations of those specifications in many languages (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby and Rust)
  * Computational tools based on those standards

# Python library: `pyarrow`

* Conversion utilities for Python <-> Arrow
* Interface to Arrow functionalities

.medium[
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3],
                   'b': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]})

import pyarrow as pa
table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
```

# Arrow use cases

# Example use cases

# Arrow use cases

* **Data access**
  * Read and write widely used storage formats
  * Interact with database protocols, other data sources

* Data movement

* Runtime data structures for analytics



---
# Apache Parquet

* Standardized, binary, columnar storage format
* Originally from the Hadoop ecosystem

--
count: false

Reading and writing Parquet files with pandas (powered by implementation in Apache Arrow):

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet("dataset.parquet")
```

- High performance
- High compression
- Query the data you need
- Preserves types

???

compared to csv: faster reading / writing, smaller file on disk, preserving data types

but also non-python specific (eg compared to pickle)

---
# Apache Parquet

Python:

```python
df = pd.read_parquet("dataset.parquet")
```

R:
```r
df <- read_parquet("dataset.parquet")
```

MATLAB:
```python
T = parquetread("dataset.parquet") 
```

All using the same Arrow implementation as pandas!

# Turbodbc

![:scale 90%](img/turbodbc-logo.svg)

* Access relational databases via the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface
* Built-in Arrow support: batched data transfer instead of single-record communication as other popular ODBC modules do.

https://github.com/blue-yonder/turbodbc

---
# Other data access examples

* Supported formats in Apache Arrow: Parquet, CSV, line-delimited JSON (more coming)

## PySpark user-defined functions

Arrow-accelerated Python + Apache Spark

* Joint work with Li Jin from Two Sigma, Bryan Cutler from IBM
* Vectorized user-defined functions, fast data export to pandas


```python

@pandas_udf('double')
def cdf(s):
    return pd.Series(stats.norm.cdf(s))

df.withColumn('cumulative_probability', cdf(df.v))

# Arrow Flight RPC Framework

* When shared memory is not an option
* Arrow-native RPC framework based on gRPC
* High performance communication
* Implement custom data services that send and receive Arrow columnar data natively

???

We are developing a new Arrow-native RPC framework, Arrow Flight, based on gRPC for high performance Arrow-based messaging. Through low-level extensions to gRPC’s internal memory management, we are able to avoid expensive parsing when receiving datasets over the wire, unlocking unprecedented levels of performance in moving datasets from one machine to another.

A gRPC-based framework for defining custom data services that send and receive Arrow columnar data natively
Uses Protocol Buffers v3 for client protocol
Pluggable command execution layer, authentication
Low-level gRPC optimizations
Write Arrow memory directly onto outgoing gRPC buffer
Avoid any copying or deserialization 

tcp over a gigabyte a second of data

# Pandas based on Arrow ?

.center[
![:scale 85%](img/pandas-arrow-demo.png)

???

What If Pandas ..

* had consistent missing data handling
* had a proper string data type
* had native support for nested data, decimals, dates, ...
* didn't make a copy for every operation
* could memory-map parts of big tables
* had a parallel query engine

---

# Pandas based on Arrow ?

The Fletcher package (of Uwe Korn) experiments with this:

* https://github.com/xhochy/fletcher
* Based on the pandas ExtensionArray interface
* Using Arrow to store data in pandas Series
